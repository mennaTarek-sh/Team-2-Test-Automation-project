📌 Testing Web Application – Graduation Project
 Project Overview

This project focuses on applying end-to-end testing on web applications to ensure quality, stability, and reliability before release.
We applied Manual Testing, Automation Testing, and API Testing to achieve full test coverage across different layers of the system.

🎯 Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to validate the web application from all aspects:
UI & User Experience
Backend Logic
Regression Stability
Instead of testing from a single angle, we ensured complete coverage using multiple testing approaches.

 Testing Types Used

Manual Testing
Used to validate UI behavior, user flows, error messages, and usability.
Test cases are documented in Google Sheets with steps, expected results, and actual results.

Automation Testing (Selenium)
Used for critical and repetitive flows such as Login, Logout, and Checkout.
Automation helps save time and ensures fast regression testing after each update.

API Testing
Used to test backend logic and data flow independently from the UI.
Includes Authentication (JWT), CRUD operations, filters, and status code validation.

🌐 Different Testing Environments

Each testing type was applied on a different web application:
Manual Testing → DemoBlaze
Automation Testing → SauceDemo
API Testing → Platzi Fake Store API
This approach proves that the testing framework is flexible and applicable to any web application, not limited to a single demo.

 Team Collaboration

The team worked collaboratively with weekly meetings to review progress and ensure that all members understood the full application flow, not only individual modules.
This ensured consistency, shared understanding, and higher testing quality.
